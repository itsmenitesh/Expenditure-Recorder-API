# Expense Tracker API

a Java and Spring Boot-built API for handling user authentication and spending.

## Frameworks and Language Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA

## Data Flow

The data flow in this project is organized using the following components:

### Controller

- The expenditure controller responds to HTTP queries. Endpoints for adding, viewing, editing, and removing costs are included.
- UsersController: Manages user-related HTTP requests, including signUp and signin.

### Services

- AuthenticationService: Provides authentication-related functionality, including saving and retrieving authentication tokens and authenticating user credentials.
- ExpenseService: Manages expense-related operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting expenses. It also provides methods to fetch expenses based on specific criteria.
- UsersService: Handles user-related operations, such as user sign up and sign in. It encrypts user passwords and verifies credentials during sign in.

### Repository

- IAuthenticationRepository: Provides methods to interact with the database for storing and retrieving authentication tokens.
- IExpenseRepository: Offers methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on expense data.
- IUsersRepository: Defines database operations related to user entities.

## Model

### Users

Represents user data, including user details and expenses. It contains fields such as user ID, first name, last name, email, password, phone number, and age.

### Expense

Represents an expense with fields like ID, title, description, price, date, time, and a reference to the associated user.

### AuthenticationToken

Stores the authentication token for a user and is associated with a specific user using a one-to-one relationship.

    ## Project Summary

The Expense Tracker API is a Java-based web application built using Spring Boot. It provides endpoints for managing expenses and user authentication. It offers endpoints for user authentication and spending management. The program has a tiered design where services implement business logic, controllers handle HTTP requests, and repositories communicate with the database. The user and expense models are the main data structures employed in the project. The expense model represents expense data, whereas the user model represents user data. DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes for managing input and output data for sign-up and sign-in activities are also included in the project.
